# Project_CustomerSegmentationUsingR

# E-commerce Sales AnalysisÂ¶

In this analysis we will be working with the E-commerce dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which contains around 150.000 transactions for an UK-based online retailer. The dataset contains actual data for the period 2010/2011 grouped by country and transaction day.

#Customer Segmentation Project in R
Customer Segmentation is one the most important applications of unsupervised learning. Using clustering techniques, companies can identify the several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base. In this machine learning project, we will make use of K-means clustering which is the essential algorithm for clustering unlabeled dataset. Before ahead in this project, learn what actually customer segmentation is.
