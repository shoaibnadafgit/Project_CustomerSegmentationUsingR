#E-commerce transaction analysis and customer and product segmentation

In this analysis we will be working with the E-commerce dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which contains around 150.000 transactions for an UK-based online retailer. The dataset contains actual data for the period 2010/2011 grouped by country and transaction day.

## Context
Typically e-commerce datasets are proprietary and consequently hard to find among publicly available data. However, The UCI Machine Learning Repository has made this dataset containing actual transactions from 2010 and 2011. The dataset is maintained on their site, where it can be found by the title "Online Retail".
